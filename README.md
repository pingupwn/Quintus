Provide ideas in a decentralized and distributed ledger technology used to store digital information that powers cryptocurrencies and NFTs and can radically change multiple sectors<br>

Our Idea:
To create a decentralized chat app or game.<br>
Using gun.js<br>

We are planning to make an Arch Linux virtual machine<br>
and then try to deploy it as a node for our app or game.
